    <pre> A session is a methods of storing data (using variables) so the browser can use it
throughout multiple webpages. In contrast to cookies, the data is not kept on the userâ€™s
system. Session variables contain data about the current user, and all pages contained
in a single web application. The session ends once the window or tab in which the
webpage was loaded, is closed. </pre>

 <?php 
 
 $_SESSION["color"]= "blue";  // Set session variables
 $_SESSION["animal"]= "dog";
 echo "The session variable are set up.";
